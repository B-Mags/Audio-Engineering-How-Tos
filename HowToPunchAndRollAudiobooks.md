# Why do we use punch-and-roll? 

Punch-and-roll is an efficient recording method that minimizes retakes. This method requires the engineer and narrator to choose takes and mitigate mistakes in the booth, resulting in a smooth post-production process. 

# Process

1. Stop the narrator and recording:
   - for errors. Errors can include slurs, stumbles, mispronunciations, awkward line reads, etc.
   - for re-reads. Re-reads occur when the direction, grammar, or emotion of the line reading needs to be changed.
2. Roll back to the last clean sentence.
3. Instruct the narrator to say the last two words of the last clean sentence.
   - The last two words of the last clean sentence will function as a recording cue for the audio engineer.
4.
