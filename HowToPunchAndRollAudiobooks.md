# Why do we use punch-and-roll? 

Punch-and-roll is an efficient recording method that minimizes retakes. This method requires the engineer and narrator to choose takes and mitigate mistakes in the booth, resulting in a smooth post-production process. 

# Process

1. Stop the narrator and recording:
   - for errors. Errors can include slurs, stumbles, mispronunciations, awkward line reads, etc.
   - for re-reads. Re-reads occur when the direction, grammar, or emotion of the line reading needs to be changed.
2. Roll back to the last clean sentence.
   - The end of the last clean sentence is the **punch point**: the point where the new recording will begin. 
4. Instruct the narrator to say the last two words of the last clean sentence.
   - The last two words of the last clean sentence will function as a **recording cue** for the audio engineer.
5. After the narrator says the **recording cue**, press record.
   - Hitting record at the punch point will record new audio over the old audio, erasing the mistake.
6. Continue until next error or re-read and repeat this process.

# After the Session 

It is good practice to clean up your punch points before consilidating the session audio. Starting from the top of the session, tab through the punch points and listen to each one. Ensure the space, room tone, and breaths are appropriately placed. Once finished, consolidate the session audio and export to WAV for editing.
