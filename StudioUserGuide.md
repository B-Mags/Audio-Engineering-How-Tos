# Studio User Guide 

## About This Guide

If you are setting up the studio for the first time, or if you need step-by-step guidance, work your way sequentially through the dropdown steps below. 

If you don't need a walkthrough, feel free to skip ahead to “Hardware Quick Settings (Reference Sheet)." There you will find all of the settings without the walkthrough. 

## Hardware Setup
