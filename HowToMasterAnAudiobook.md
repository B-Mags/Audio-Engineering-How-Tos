# How To Master An Audiobook

## Take it step-by-step

The following guide illustrates how to master an audiobook to Recorded Books specifications. All deliverables should meet these specifications. 

If you are new to this process, follow this guide sequentially. 

## 1. Session Details 

### First, check your session details. 
 1. Open the session settings (Setup -> Session).
 2. Set the sample rate is set to 44.1kHz. 
 3. Set the bit depth to 16-bit.

## 2. Importing Your Audio

### Drag-and-drop makes importing easy. 
1. Create a mono track in your Pro Tools session.
2. Drag your audio into the clip bins.  
    a. If your audio does not conform to the session settings, Pro Tools will automatically convert the audio. When this process occurs, the new audio is automatically stored in the session's "Audio" folder. 
3. Drag the audio from the clip bin into your new track. 
4. Tab through the tracks to make sure the chapters are in order on the track.

## 3. Check File Durations

### Make sure each file is 60 minutes or fewer. 

If a chapter is longer than 60 minutes, find logical cutting points in the chapter to create multiple files. Each new file must be fewer than 60 minutes.

## 4. File Creation

### Create the first file. 

1. Make sure the intro is appended to the first chapter.
   a. There should be three seconds of room tone between the end of the intro and the beginning of the first chapter.
