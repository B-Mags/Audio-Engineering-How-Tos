## 2. Importing Your Audio

### Importing
1. Create a mono track in your Pro Tools session. 
2. Drag your audio into the clip bins.  
    a. If your audio does not conform to the session settings, Pro Tools will automatically convert the audio. When this process occurs, the new audio is automatically stored in the session's "Audio" folder. 
3. Drag the audio from the clip bin into your new track. 
4. Tab through the tracks to make sure the chapters are in order on the track
